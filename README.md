# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-Simulator
A simple Java Swing application that simulates CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin. Users can input process data, run an algorithm, and view the calculated waiting and turnaround times. The tool is designed mainly for students to understand and visualize how process scheduling works in operating systems.
